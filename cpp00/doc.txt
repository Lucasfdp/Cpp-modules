1. std::string

---

* **What it is:** A class from the C++ Standard Library used to store and manipulate sequences of characters.
* **Advantages over char arrays:**

  * Dynamic size (grows or shrinks automatically)
  * Automatic memory management
  * Built-in operations for concatenation, comparison, searching, and substrings
* **Namespace:** std::string belongs to the `std` namespace, which organizes standard library functionality and avoids name collisions.
* **Key properties:**

  * Length, mutable content, automatic memory ownership
* **Comparison with C-style strings:** safer, easier, and more flexible.

2. Classes and Access Specifiers

---

* **Class:** Blueprint for creating objects; defines attributes (data) and methods (behavior).
* **Objects:** Instances of a class, each with its own state.
* **Access specifiers:**

  * `public`: Accessible from anywhere
  * `private`: Accessible only within the class
  * `protected`: Accessible within the class and its derived classes
* **Encapsulation:** Access specifiers help control object state and maintain integrity.

---

3. Constructors and Destructors

---

* **Constructor:** Initializes an object; runs automatically when an object is created. Can be overloaded.
* **Destructor:** Cleans up resources; runs automatically when an object goes out of scope. Prefixed with `~` and cannot take parameters.
* **Object lifetime:**

  * Start: Constructor runs
  * Usage: Object interacts via public methods
  * End: Destructor runs, releasing resources
* **RAII (Resource Acquisition Is Initialization):** Pattern where resource allocation happens in the constructor and cleanup in the destructor.

---

4. Const Correctness

---

* **Purpose:** Prevent accidental modification of variables, parameters, or objects.
* **Contexts:**

  * `const` variable: Cannot change value after initialization
  * `const` function parameter: Function cannot modify the argument
  * `const` member function: Object state cannot be modified inside the function
* **Pointers and const:**

  * `T* ptr`: Pointer and data both mutable
  * `const T* ptr`: Pointer mutable, data immutable
  * `T* const ptr`: Pointer immutable, data mutable
  * `const T* const ptr`: Both pointer and data immutable
* **Benefits:** Safer code, communicates intent, allows compiler optimizations

---

5. Static Members

---

* **Static variable:** Shared among all objects; only one copy exists. Useful for counters or shared configuration.
* **Static function:** Can access only static members, does not have a `this` pointer, callable using class name without creating an object.
* **Advantages:** Memory efficiency, global-like access within class scope, logically belongs to class rather than individual objects.

| Concept                    | Key Point                                        |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| std::string                | Dynamic, safe text storage and manipulation      |
| Class                      | Blueprint for objects (attributes + methods)     |
| Access specifiers          | Controls visibility: public, private, protected  |
| Constructor                | Initializes object automatically                 |
| Destructor                 | Cleans up object automatically                   |
| Const correctness          | Protects variables, parameters, and object state |
| Pointer const combinations | Pointer vs. data mutability control              |
| Static members             | Shared among all objects of a class              |
